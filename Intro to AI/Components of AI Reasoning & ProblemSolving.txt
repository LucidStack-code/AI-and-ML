***Components of AI: Reasoning & Problem-Solving 🧠🤖***

    AI systems rely on reasoning and problem-solving to make decisions, find solutions, and optimize processes. These capabilities allow AI to mimic human intelligence in  
    logical thinking and decision-making.

  1. Reasoning 🔍🧠

      AI system use logic and inference to make decisions and draw conclusion from available data.

        - Deductive Reasoning 🔽 – Uses general rules to derive specific conclusions (e.g., "All humans are mortal; John is human; therefore, John is mortal.").
        - Inductive Reasoning 🔼 – Learns patterns from data and makes predictions (e.g., recognizing trends in stock markets).
        - Abductive Reasoning 🤔 – Makes the best possible guess based on incomplete information (e.g., AI in medical diagnosis suggesting the most likely disease based on symptoms).
    📌 Example: AI in legal systems uses reasoning to analyze past cases and predict outcomes.

  2. Problem-Solving 🧩🔢

      AI can analyze situations, recognize patterns, and determine the best course of action to solve complex problems.
      AI solves complex problems by searching for optimal solutions using different strategies:

      - Search Algorithms 🔍 – AI explores different possibilities (e.g., Dijkstra’s Algorithm for shortest path, A* for game AI).
      - Optimization Techniques 📈 – AI finds the best solution among many (e.g., scheduling airline flights efficiently).
      - Constraint Satisfaction 📏 – AI solves puzzles and planning problems by considering multiple constraints (e.g., Sudoku solvers, exam timetabling).

    📌 Example: AI in robotics calculates the best path for a robot to navigate obstacles.

  3. Planning 📅🧠

      AI can set goals and devise strategies to acheive them by predicting outcomes and adjusting actions accordingly.
      AI uses planning to set goals and determine the best sequence of actions to achieve them.

      - Path Planning – AI calculates the most efficient route (e.g., Google Maps navigation).
      - Task Scheduling – AI optimizes task execution in industries (e.g., scheduling airline flights).
      - Game AI – AI plans moves in chess or strategy games using decision trees (e.g., AlphaGo).

    📌 Example: Self-driving cars use AI planning to navigate traffic safely.

  4. Learning 📚🧑‍🎓

      Machine Learning enables Artificial Intelligence 🧠 to improve its performance based on data and past expereinces.
      AI improves over time by learning from data and experience. There are different types of learning:

      - Supervised Learning 🎯 – AI learns from labeled data (e.g., spam detection in emails).
      - Unsupervised Learning 🔍 – AI finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation in marketing).
      - Reinforcement Learning 🕹️ – AI learns through trial and error with rewards (e.g., robots learning to walk).

    📌 Example: AI in Netflix learns user preferences and recommends personalized shows.

  5. Natural Language Processing (NLP) 🗣️📖

      Artificial Intelligence can understand, interpret and generate human language, enabling interaction like chatbots and voice assistants.
      NLP enables AI to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Key aspects include:

      - Speech Recognition 🎤 – Converts speech to text (e.g., Siri, Google Assistant).
      - Machine Translation 🌍 – AI translates languages (e.g., Google Translate).
      - Chatbots 🤖💬 – AI interacts with users in real-time (e.g., ChatGPT, customer support bots).
      - Sentiment Analysis 😊😡 – AI detects emotions in text (e.g., social media sentiment tracking).

    📌 Example: AI in Gmail suggests email replies with "Smart Reply."

  6. Perception 👀👂

      Artificial Intelligence processes sensory inputs <like images, sounds and signals> using techniques such as computer vision and speech recognition. 
      AI perceives the world using sensors and interprets information like humans do.

      - Computer Vision 📷 – AI processes images and videos (e.g., facial recognition, object detection).
      - Speech Processing 🗣️ – AI understands spoken words (e.g., voice assistants).
      - Sensor-based Perception 🚗 – AI in self-driving cars uses LiDAR, cameras, and sensors to detect surroundings.

    📌 Example: AI in medical imaging detects diseases from X-rays and MRIs.
