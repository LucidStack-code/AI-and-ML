*** Types of AI 🤖 ***

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is categorized based on capabilities (how powerful the AI is) and functionalities (how the AI works).
1. Based on Capabilities 🚀

This classification determines the intelligence level of an AI system.
🔹 Narrow AI (Weak AI)

    AI that is designed for a specific task and cannot perform beyond its programming.
    It does not have general reasoning or adaptability like humans.
    It cannot perform task beyond its field or limitations, as it is trained for specified task.
    Examples:
        ChatGPT – Can generate human-like text but cannot think independently.
        Siri/Google Assistant – Provides voice-based assistance but doesn’t have emotions or deep understanding.
        Netflix Recommendations – Suggests shows based on past viewing history.

🔹 General AI (Strong AI)

    AI that can perform any intellectual task just like a human.
    It has reasoning, problem-solving abilities, and can learn from experiences.
    The idea behind general AI is to make such a system which could be smarter or atleast able to think like a human or on its own.
    Example:
        Hypothetical AI like Jarvis (from Iron Man) – Can understand, think, and respond like a human.
        No real-world example yet, but researchers are working on it.

🔹 Super AI (Artificial Superintelligence)

    AI that surpasses human intelligence in every aspect – creativity, emotions, decision-making.
    It can think and act independently, possibly outperforming humans.
    It can perform any task better than humans with congnitive properties. It is still a hypothetical concept of AI.
    Example:
        Skynet (from Terminator) – A fictional AI that controls everything and surpasses human intelligence.
        Currently, no real-world example exists.


2. Based on Functionalities ⚙️

This classification defines how an AI system processes and interacts with information.
🟢 Reactive Machines

    The simplest type of AI that can only react to the present situation.
    It does not store past experiences (no memory).
    Example:
        IBM’s Deep Blue – A chess-playing AI that defeated world champion Garry Kasparov by analyzing current moves but had no memory of past games.

🟡 Limited Memory

    AI that can remember past experiences for a short time and use them to make better decisions.
    Used in self-driving cars, fraud detection, and recommendation systems.
    Example:
        Tesla Autopilot – Uses past data to improve driving decisions (e.g., recognizing traffic patterns).
        Chatbots – Can remember recent messages in a conversation but forget older interactions.

🔵 Theory of Mind (Future AI)

    AI that understands human emotions, beliefs, and intentions.
    It can interact socially and predict behavior based on past interactions.
    Still in research and not fully developed.
    Example:
        AI-powered robots that can understand human expressions and emotions (still theoretical).

🔴 Self-Awareness (Hypothetical AI)

    The most advanced AI (currently nonexistent).
    It has its own consciousness, self-awareness, and emotions, similar to a human brain.
    Example:
        If an AI ever develops emotions, self-reflection, and independent thoughts, it will fall under this category.
