                                                    Artificial Intelligence
**Origin**
  So first of all AI is made of two root words: 1. Artificial and 2. Intelligence meaning,
  Artificial = Man-made and Intelligence = Thinking power ðŸ¤” 
  Therefor, AI = Man-made Thinking Power.

**Definition**
  It is a branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent machines which can behave like a human, think like human and able to make decisions.
  It has human based skills like - a] Reasoning   b] Learning    c] Problem Solving

# This is how we can define Ai in simple, but there are many more thhings that need to be taken in consideration while defining Ai lets, look some other definition of Ai.

  1] "Intelligence : The ability to learn and solve problems."
  2] "Artificial Intelligence(AI) is the intelligence ðŸ§  exhibited by machines or sortware."
  3] "The science and engineering of making intelligent machines."
  4] "The study and design of intelligent agents, where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success."


**Goals of AI ðŸ¥… **
  a] Replicating Humann Intelligence - means to think, act and reason like human
  b] Learn new things itself from previously added data or promt.
  c] Demonstrate new things efficently.
  d] Advice to user - to advice user the better alternative based on the promt provided to make work fast and efficient.

** Why do we need AI ??...**

  1] With the help of AI, one can create such software or devices which can solve real-world problems very easily and woth accuracy such as health issues, traffic issues, etc.
  2] One can build Robots which cn work in an environment where survival of humans can be at risk.
  3] AI opens the path for other new technologies, new devices and new opportunities.
  4] Analyze data more deeply and is capable of explaining it more effectively.
  5] For security and work efficiently.
  6] Ai can be used to make an intelligent decision as compared to human beings.
  7] To create expert systems having the capability to explain and give advice to user.
  8] To speed ðŸš¤ up work performance.
