🤖 PEAS Representation in AI
📌 What is PEAS?

The PEAS framework is used to define an intelligent agent in a structured way. It helps in designing and analyzing agents by specifying what they need to function properly.
Basically, it is a framework used to define the components of an intelligent Agent.
It helps in designing and analyzing AI systems by specifying what the agent perceives, how it acts and what golas it must achieves.

🔹 PEAS Components

✔ Performance Measure (P) 🎯 – The criteria to evaluate how well the agent is performing.
✔ Environment (E) 🌍 – The surroundings in which the agent operates.
✔ Actuators (A) 🤖 – The components that allow the agent to take actions in the environment.
✔ Sensors (S) 👀 – The components that allow the agent to perceive the environment.

📌 PEAS Example: Self-Driving Car 🚗

| **Component**        | **Self-Driving Car Example 🚗** |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Performance Measure (P) 🎯** | Safe driving, fuel efficiency, fast route selection, following traffic rules. |
| **Environment (E) 🌍** | Roads, traffic, pedestrians, weather conditions. |
| **Actuators (A) 🤖** | Steering wheel, accelerator, brakes, signals, horn. |
| **Sensors (S) 👀** | Cameras, LiDAR, GPS, speedometer, radar. |

📌 PEAS Example: Vacuum Cleaner 🏠

| **Component**        | **Vacuum Cleaner Example 🏠** |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Performance Measure (P) 🎯** | Clean floor, battery efficiency, minimal collisions. |
| **Environment (E) 🌍** | Home, dust, furniture, obstacles, different floor types. |
| **Actuators (A) 🤖** | Wheels, suction motor, brushes, dustbin. |
| **Sensors (S) 👀** | Dirt sensor, bump sensor, proximity sensor. |

📌 PEAS Representation Summary Table

| **Component**        | **Description** |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Performance Measure (P) 🎯** | Defines success criteria for the agent. |
| **Environment (E) 🌍** | The external world where the agent operates. |
| **Actuators (A) 🤖** | Components that take actions to affect the environment. |
| **Sensors (S) 👀** | Components that gather information from the environment. |

The PEAS framework is a structured way to define an intelligent agent, specifying what it needs to function
properly. It consists of four components: Performance Measure, Environment, Actuators, and Sensors.
