            INTELLIGENT AGENTS 

***🤖 What is an AI Agent? *** 

An agent is anything that can sense the world around it (through sensors) and take actions in the world (through actuators).
🔍 What does an Agent do?

An agent can:
✅ Perceive its environment – Understand what is happening using sensors 🏞️👀
✅ Act upon the environment – Take actions based on what it senses using actuators 🤖⚡

🧠 Two Main Parts of an Agent:

  1️⃣ Perception 👀 (Sensing the Environment) :
    Perceiving means gathering information about the environment through sensors.
    Sensors are tools that help the agent understand what is happening around it.
  e.g.: A robot vaccum has sensors 📡 that can detect dirt, obstacles and walls 🏠  in its surroundings.

  2️⃣ Action 🤖 (Acting on Environment) :
    After perceiving its environment, the agent takes action to acheive its goals.
    It does this using actuators (tools that allow the agent to move or make changes.
  e.g.: A robot vaccum uses motor to move around.

***🌟 Why is an AI Agent Important? ***
    The concept of an agent is important because it helps us understand how machines or systems interact with the world.
  🔄 How an Agent Works?
    1️⃣ Sensors 📡 → Perceive information from the environment.
    2️⃣ Processing Unit (Brain) 🧠 → Decides what action to take.
    3️⃣ Actuators 🤖 → Perform actions based on perception.

*** 🤖 Agents in AI ***
  An agent in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is any entity that can perceive its environment through sensors and take actions through actuators to achieve a goal. 
  AI agents are designed to automate tasks, solve problems, and interact with their surroundings intelligently.
  There are different types of AI agents, categorized based on their nature and functionality.

  🔹 1. Human Agent 🧑‍💻
        A human agent refers to a person who acts or interacts with the system or environment. In Ai, humans can be seen as agents when they make decisions based on their perceprions, reasoning and actions.
        Humans can interact with AI system, provide feedback and influence decisions made by AI agents.
