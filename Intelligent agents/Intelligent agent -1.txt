            INTELLIGENT AGENTS 

***🤖 What is an AI Agent? *** 

An agent is anything that can sense the world around it (through sensors) and take actions in the world (through actuators).
🔍 What does an Agent do?

An agent can:
✅ Perceive its environment – Understand what is happening using sensors 🏞️👀
✅ Act upon the environment – Take actions based on what it senses using actuators 🤖⚡

🧠 Two Main Parts of an Agent:

  1️⃣ Perception 👀 (Sensing the Environment) :
    Perceiving means gathering information about the environment through sensors.
    Sensors are tools that help the agent understand what is happening around it.
  e.g.: A robot vaccum has sensors 📡 that can detect dirt, obstacles and walls 🏠  in its surroundings.

  2️⃣ Action 🤖 (Acting on Environment) :
    After perceiving its environment, the agent takes action to acheive its goals.
    It does this using actuators (tools that allow the agent to move or make changes.
  e.g.: A robot vaccum uses motor to move around.

***🌟 Why is an AI Agent Important? ***
    The concept of an agent is important because it helps us understand how machines or systems interact with the world.
  🔄 How an Agent Works?
    1️⃣ Sensors 📡 → Perceive information from the environment.
    2️⃣ Processing Unit (Brain) 🧠 → Decides what action to take.
    3️⃣ Actuators 🤖 → Perform actions based on perception.
