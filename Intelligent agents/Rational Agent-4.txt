🤖 Rational Agent in AI
📌 What is a Rational Agent?

A rational agent is an entity in AI that:
✔️ Perceives its environment through sensors 👀
✔️ Processes the received information 🧠
✔️ Acts in a way that maximizes its performance measure 🎯
✔️ Makes the best possible decision based on available information ✅

🔹 Key Characteristics of a Rational Agent:

1️⃣ Clear Preferences – The agent has a well-defined goal.
2️⃣ Model Uncertainty – The agent considers uncertainties in the environment.
3️⃣ Optimized Actions – The agent takes actions that maximize its success.


🎯 Why Rational Action is Important?

    In Reinforcement Learning (RL):
    ✅ Correct actions → Positive rewards 🏆
    ❌ Wrong actions → Negative rewards ❌
    Ensures AI learns effectively and improves over time.

📌 Rationality in AI

Rationality is defined relative to the performance measure and the agent’s knowledge.

🔹 Key Aspects of Rationality:

| **Aspect**            | **Description** |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Performance Measure** 🎯 | The metric used to evaluate the success of an agent. |
| **Percept Sequence** 👀 | The history of all perceptions the agent has received so far. |
| **Knowledge Base** 📚 | What the agent knows about the environment. |
| **Action Selection** 🔄 | The process of choosing the most optimal action based on perception and knowledge. |
