*** 🤖 Agents in AI ***
  An agent in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is any entity that can perceive its environment through sensors and take actions through actuators to achieve a goal. 
  AI agents are designed to automate tasks, solve problems, and interact with their surroundings intelligently.
  There are different types of AI agents, categorized based on their nature and functionality.

  🔹 1. Human Agent 🧑‍💻
        A human agent refers to a person who acts or interacts with the system or environment. In Ai, humans can be seen as agents when they make decisions based on their perceprions, reasoning and actions.
        Humans can interact with AI system, provide feedback and influence decisions made by AI agents.
        
        Characteristics:

        Uses sensory organs (eyes, ears, skin, nose, tongue) to perceive the environment.
        Uses a brain for processing information and decision-making.
        Uses limbs and voice for taking actions.

        Examples:

        A doctor diagnosing a patient based on symptoms and prescribing medicine.
        A pilot flying an airplane by interpreting cockpit instruments and adjusting controls.
        A teacher explaining a concept after analyzing students’ responses.

        Advantages:

      ✅ High-level reasoning and complex decision-making.
      ✅ Adaptability to new and unforeseen situations.
      ✅ Emotional intelligence for social interactions.

        Disadvantages:

      ❌ Limited processing speed compared to machines.
      ❌ Prone to fatigue, errors, and biases.
      ❌ Slow learning in comparison to AI-based agents.

      2. Robotic Agent 🤖

        A robotic agent is a physical machine that interacts with the real world using sensors and actuators. It perceives its surroundings and takes actions based on pre-programmed instructions or AI-based decision-making.
      
        Characteristics:

        -Uses sensors (cameras, LiDAR, microphones) to perceive its environment.
        -Uses actuators (motors, robotic arms) to perform physical actions.
        -Can be fully autonomous or remotely controlled.
        -Can perform repetitive, dangerous, or precision-based tasks.

        Examples:

        -Autonomous Vehicles (Tesla, Waymo): Use cameras, radar, and AI to navigate roads.
        -Industrial Robots (ABB, FANUC): Perform assembly line tasks with high precision.
        -Surgical Robots (Da Vinci Robot): Assist doctors in minimally invasive surgeries.
        -Space Exploration Robots (Mars Rover, Perseverance): Explore and analyze distant planets.

        Advantages:

        ✅ Can operate in hazardous environments (space, deep-sea, nuclear plants).
        ✅ Higher precision and efficiency than human agents.
        ✅ Works continuously without fatigue.

        Disadvantages:

        ❌ Limited decision-making in complex scenarios.
        ❌ High cost of development and maintenance.
        ❌ Lack of human-like intuition and adaptability.

      3. Software Agent 💻

        A software agent is a virtual entity that exists in a digital environment, processes data, makes decisions, and performs tasks autonomously without direct human intervention.
      
        Characteristics:

        -Operates in cyberspace (on computers, networks, or cloud servers).
        -Can interact with other systems, applications, or users.
        -Uses AI algorithms, data processing, and decision-making models.
        -Can be rule-based (if-else logic) or AI-based (machine learning, deep learning).

        Examples:

        -Chatbots (ChatGPT, Siri, Google Assistant) – Understand user queries and respond intelligently.
        -Recommendation Systems (Netflix, YouTube, Amazon) – Suggest content based on user behavior.
        -Cybersecurity Bots (Antivirus, Intrusion Detection Systems) – Monitor and protect systems from cyber threats.
        -Stock Trading Bots (Algo Trading) – Analyze market trends and execute trades automatically.

        Advantages:

        ✅ Processes vast amounts of data quickly.
        ✅ Works 24/7 without breaks.
        ✅ Can be deployed at a large scale over networks.

        Disadvantages:

        ❌ Limited understanding of real-world scenarios.
        ❌ Prone to biases and errors based on training data.
        ❌ Security and privacy risks if not properly managed.
